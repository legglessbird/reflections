When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- as a backup
- for collaboration
- using multiple computers so can sync commits
- for public sharing

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because there may be other collaborators who had push to remote repository but you may not want those on your local repository yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are a feature of GitHub only - it is basically a clone of another repository on GitHub so that a reference point to the original repository/owner
clones are making a copy of a repository to another repository
branches are different paths of commits within a repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
because there may be other collaborators whom may commit into the remote since then which you may not want to have in your local repository.
also, if there's no local remote copy, then git will always check with the remote and the state may have changed each time due to commits from other collaborators

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It's a lot harder especially working with multiple collaborators. I can't imagine how. Perhaps use other CVS.

Using Git and GitHub would be much easier!
