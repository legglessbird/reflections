When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- as a backup
- for collaboration
- using multiple computers so can sync commits
- for public sharing

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because there may be other collaborators who had push to remote repository but you may not want those on your local repository yet
