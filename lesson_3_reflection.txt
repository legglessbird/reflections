When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- as a backup
- for collaboration
- using multiple computers so can sync commits
- for public sharing

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because there may be other collaborators who had push to remote repository but you may not want those on your local repository yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are a feature of GitHub only - it is basically a clone of another repository on GitHub so that a reference point to the original repository/owner
clones are making a copy of a repository to another repository
branches are different paths of commits within a repository
