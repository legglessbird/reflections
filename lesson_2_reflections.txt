What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git folder is created to store git metadata
so that git can be used to track commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area - like buffer; temp working space in memory
working directory - where all the files reside
repository - is the glue for the git system

staging area is like a temp working space in the memory before files are commit etc
