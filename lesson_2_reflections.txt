What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git folder is created to store git metadata
so that git can be used to track commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

1) working directory - where all the files reside; the actual files at any time
2) staging area - files added to a temp space until they are committed
3) repository - keeps the history of all the commits

allows you add multiple files for a single commit
temp buffer to add or remove files for a single commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

check via 'git status' to see what files are in the staging area
add/remove files for a single logical commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

so I can experiment with new code, technique or some other stuff
can have different branches for different languages
and of course keep the working master branch just in case

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

so that you can see how each branch forked out, from which commit and how the move along with their own commits.
You can see its parent and whether there's any commit that is unreachable
